## Instructions

1. Clone repository.
2. Change directory to root of project, i.e., where index.html resides.
3. Type "http-server . -o" to run project.
  a. This command runs npm's simple command-line http server and opens a browser window to the index.html page.
  b. You can install http-server by first installing node.js, which installs npm, then using npm to install http-server. 

#### The project will still run without AJAX just by double-clicking index.html.  However, there is an AJAX widget on the "About" page that will not appear.

## Notes on Project
